### Typing Speed Test

Typing Speed test is a website made with simple usability and good performance in mind using React and TypeScript, where you can [**_quickly practice_** your typing speed](https://justan0therdev.github.io/TypingSpeedTest/).

Just keep it somewhere where its easily accessible, quickly open it up and practice a bit.

## Usability
- If you're not familiar with websites like this, just type away and the words will be matched when the space key is pressed.
- Pressing the `Escape` key on your keyboard resets your progress.

This project is still on-going, so feel free to give it a star, fork it, make pull requests, open up issues and such!
