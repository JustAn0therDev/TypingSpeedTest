### Typing Speed Test

Typing Speed test is a website made with simple usability and performance in mind using React and TypeScript, where you can [**_quickly practice_** your typing speed](https://justan0therdev.github.io/TypingSpeedTest/).

Just keep it somewhere where its easily accessible, quickly open it up and practice a bit.

## Usability
- If you're not familiar with websites like this, just type away and the words will be matched when the space key is pressed;
- When you get to the end of the word list, your score based on the number of words typed per minute will be shown at the bottom;
- Pressing the `Escape` key on your keyboard at any time resets your current progress.

## Colors
To change and reset colors to default as you feel like it, there are two buttons for it:
- The Change Colors button shows two other buttons that open a [*react-colorful "color-picker"*](https://github.com/omgovich/react-colorful), each one being for the background and foreground of the application. Your color of choice will be kept in `localStorage` so it will still be there when you come back (as long as you don't clean it up);
- The Reset Colors does exactly what it says.

This project is still on-going, so feel free to give it a star, fork it, make pull requests, open up issues and such!
